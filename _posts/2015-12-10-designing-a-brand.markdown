Thought Process:
All of my personal art draws from nature. Sinuous lines, spirals, forked branches, and vibrant colors are pervasive in the vast majority of images I create. Dramatic colors, contrast, and chiaroscuro are prevalent. However, when designing a website, I have learned/been learning, my art style doesn't really mesh completely. Learning to tone it down has become standard for web design. I love a color, lighten by 70-80%, and maybe then it's okay. Then desaturate. It's a process. 

I'm going to try something different this time around. Start with snow or light gray, then add in logo and fields and make it work from there. Simple.
